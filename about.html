    <h1>About me</h1>
    
    <p>I discovered my love of theatre around two years ago, and dove in headfirst. I have a passion for surrealism, improvisation, and esoterica of all kinds.</p>
    
    <h3>Theatre </h3>

    <p>Theatre was where I started my performing arts career. Before discovering theatre, I had thought that the arts were little more than a distraction from the important activities like math and science. After finding theatre, I've begun to think the opposite. I love the use of theatre as a means of spreading a message, gaining understanding of the self and society, and opening minds. I appreciate the inherent surrealism of theatre, especially realistic theatre. </p>

    <h3>Dance </h3>
    
    <p>If theatre was my first kiss, then dance was the loving relationship I found after. Using movement as a means of telling a story, reliving a memory, and shedding the burdens of modern life. </p>
    <h3>Computing and Design </h3>
    <p>As with many people around my age, I was partially raised by the Internet, for better or for worse. I've had largely unrestricted access to screens since I was about seven, and It's certainly affected me. I believe the Interenet can be used for good, and hope to help push it in that direction. I love graphic design, building towers, and basically anything to do with simple computing. Despite knowing lots of fancy jargon, I really only know enough to be dangerous.</p>
